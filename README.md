## 🏁 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository: https://github.com/AhmdSAKamel/DrivingLicense-Management-System.git

2. Restore the Database
The project includes a backup file of the SQL Server database:

Copy code
DVLDDB.bak
Open SQL Server Management Studio.

Restore the .bak file into a new database named DVLDDB.

Make sure you're using SQL Server 2022 or compatible to avoid compatibility issues.

3. Configure the Connection String
The application will prompt you to enter database connection settings on the first launch (if the connection string is not configured yet).

You'll be asked to enter:

Server: localhost (or your SQL Server instance)

Database: DVLDDB

Username: sa

Password: 123456789 (or your SQL login)

The connection will be saved to the App.config file for future use.

4. Login with Demo Credentials
A demo user is available to log in:

Username: user1

Password: 1234
