### 1. Clone the Repository: [https://github.com/AhmdSAKamel/DrivingLicense-Management-System.git](https://github.com/AhmdSAKamel/DrivingLicenseManagementSystem.git)

2. Restore the Database
The project includes a backup file of the SQL Server database: DVLDDB.bak

Open SQL Server Management Studio.

Restore the .bak file into a new database named DVLDDB. (Or any)

Make sure you're using SQL Server 2022 or compatible to avoid compatibility issues.

3. Configure the Connection String

You'll be asked to enter:

Server: localhost (or your SQL Server instance)
Database: DVLDDB
Username: me (For ex)
Password: 123456789 (or your SQL login)

The connection will be saved to the App.config file for future use.
